## Introduction

This application has the objective of testing the https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com web page, using Cypress as a web test framework.

I used versions `v16.20.2` and `8.19.4` of Node.js and npm, respectively, and the `v5.1.0` of chai.
I suggest you use the same or later versions.
